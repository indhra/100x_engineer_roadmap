# 🧠 AI Architect Fundamentals — 2-Day Intensive

> **Goal:** Become someone who can **design intelligent systems**, **debug cognition**, and **build products that think**.
>
> **Duration:** 2 Days (8-10 hrs/day)  
> **Format:** Deep conceptual mastery → Mental models → Architect exercises  
> **Prerequisites:** Solid Python, basic ML awareness. No prior LLM systems experience needed.

## Why This Exists

Your 12-week roadmap teaches you HOW to build. This 2-day intensive teaches you **HOW TO THINK** — the architectural intuition that makes everything else 10x more effective.

Most people jump into tools (LangChain, vector DBs, agent frameworks). You will start with **first principles** so you can:
- Evaluate any tool in 5 minutes
- Design systems that don't exist yet
- Debug problems no StackOverflow answer covers

## The Three Architect Pillars

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              AI ARCHITECT MINDSET                │
├─────────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┤
│   DESIGN        │    DEBUG      │    BUILD      │
│   Intelligent   │    Cognition  │    Thinking   │
│   Systems       │               │    Products   │
├─────────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤
│ How to structure │ How to find  │ How to ship   │
│ AI that reasons  │ why AI fails │ AI that works │
│ correctly        │ & fix it     │ in the world  │

## Curriculum Map

### DAY 1: Foundations + Design (8-10 hrs)

| Section | File | Time | Focus |
|---------|------|------|-------|
| **S1** | [01_how_ai_systems_think.md](01_how_ai_systems_think.md) | 3-4 hrs | Transformers, tokens, embeddings, inference — the machine under the hood |
| **S2** | [02_design_intelligent_systems.md](02_design_intelligent_systems.md) | 4-5 hrs | Architecture patterns, context engineering, RAG, agents vs workflows |

### DAY 2: Debug + Build (8-10 hrs)

| Section | File | Time | Focus |
|---------|------|------|-------|
| **S3** | [03_debug_cognition.md](03_debug_cognition.md) | 4-5 hrs | Evaluation, observability, failure modes, tracing, fixing reasoning |
| **S4** | [04_build_thinking_products.md](04_build_thinking_products.md) | 4-5 hrs | Product architecture, production patterns, shipping AI that works |

### Self-Assessment

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [05_exercises_and_assessment.md](05_exercises_and_assessment.md) | Hands-on architect exercises + self-evaluation rubric |

## How to Use This

### Study Method (per section)
1. **Read once quickly** — get the landscape (30 min)
2. **Read again slowly** — annotate, question, argue with the text (60-90 min)
3. **Answer architect questions** — without looking back (30 min)
4. **Draw from memory** — sketch the key diagrams on paper (15 min)
5. **Explain to a rubber duck** — if you can't explain simply, re-read (15 min)

### Rules
- **No code yet.** This is about thinking, not typing.
- **Argue with every statement.** "Is this actually true? When would it break?"
- **Build mental models.** A good mental model beats 100 tutorials.
- **Take breaks.** Cognitive load is real. Walk every 90 min.

## What Success Looks Like

After these 2 days, you should be able to:

- [ ] Explain how a transformer processes "The battery temperature is 45°C" — from tokens to output
- [ ] Draw an AI system architecture for any use case in under 10 minutes
- [ ] List 5 reasons an LLM might give wrong answers and the fix for each
- [ ] Choose between a workflow and an agent (and defend your choice)
- [ ] Design an evaluation strategy before writing a single line of code
- [ ] Identify the bottleneck in a failing AI system within minutes
- [ ] Architect an AI product from user problem → deployed system
